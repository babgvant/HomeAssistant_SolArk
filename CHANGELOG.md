# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

- Refresh inverter summaries on every plant poll so PV energy comparisons use
  readings from the same polling cycle. Mark absent inverter summaries as stale.
- Report endpoint availability and sample age; keep inverter day-parameter
  diagnostics separate from inverter-summary fallback values.
- Compute the instantaneous diagnostic balance from plant flow when optional
  inverter flow responses are empty, and use plant PV flow as a power fallback.
- Added redacted endpoint-by-endpoint PV, inverter AC, load, battery, and grid
  measurements to Home Assistant diagnostics.
- Added explicit source/sink power and native daily-energy balance diagnostics.
- Added the plant `generation/use` endpoint as a diagnostic cross-check for the
  portal's PV, load, battery-charge, and grid-export energy summary.
- Fix whole-site PV power, today, and lifetime totals for parallel systems by using a
  completeness-checked sum of per-inverter values.
- Add aggregate provenance/completeness attributes and instantaneous power-balance
  diagnostics.
- Preserve previously discovered inverter topology across transient short API lists.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Native per-inverter and aggregated plant load-energy-today sensors.
- Expose all normalized inverter electrical, energy, temperature, PV-string,
  generator, gateway, battery-limit, status, and binary operating telemetry.
- Plant, gateway, inverter, and aggregate battery device hierarchy with stable IDs.
- Parallel inverter discovery and informational per-equipment diagnostics.
- Plant battery charge/discharge power and Energy Dashboard-ready persistent energy
  entities for grid import/export, battery charge/discharge, and load.
- Native inverter PV/load/grid/battery/generator energy parsing from the portal API.
- Cached topology/detail polling, partial auxiliary-endpoint failure handling, and
  credential reauthentication.
- Sanitized API research, HAR inventory tooling, and normalization tests.

### Changed

- Plant endpoints are authoritative; equipment metrics are never summed into plant
  totals.
- Daily energy counters now use reset-aware `total` semantics.
- Missing API fields remain unavailable instead of being coerced to zero.
- Diagnostics now report topology/features without serials, account IDs, or raw data.
- Removed the requirement to create Energy Dashboard helpers manually.

### Security

- API routes, query values, response bodies, serials, and plant identifiers are no
  longer emitted by request/debug logging.

## [5.0.2] - 2026-08-03

### Security

- Username, password, and OAuth tokens are redacted from debug/error logs.
- Removed the always-on `solark_debug.log` file handler (use HA logger instead).

### Fixed

- **PV power** now includes `minPower` (microinverter / AC-coupled PV) from the energy flow endpoint.
- **Battery power** is signed using flow direction flags (`batTo` = discharge +, `toBat` = charge −).
- **Grid import/export** fall back to `gridOrMeterPower` + `gridTo`/`toGrid` when external meter phases are unused.
- **Energy total/today** prefer plant `/realtime` values over inverter-list totals.
- Guard against placeholder `dy/store` MPPT volt/current ramps being treated as live PV.

## [5.0.1] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- **SolArk Cloud API host migration** - The portal moved to `www.solarkcloud.com` with API base `https://p2.api.solarkcloud.com`. Defaults and existing installs that still used `mysolark.com` / `ecsprod-api-new.solarkcloud.com` are updated automatically on reload.
- Energy today/total now also falls back to the plant `/realtime` endpoint when inverter summary values are missing.

### Added

- **Auto-discover API URL** - Reads `VUE_APP_BASE_API` from the SolArk portal frontend and stores the resolved API URL on the config entry. Toggleable in setup and Configure options; manual API URL remains as override/fallback.

## [5.0.0] - 2024-11-21
